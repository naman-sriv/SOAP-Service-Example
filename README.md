# SOAP Service Example

Welcome to the **SOAP Service Example** repository!

This project demonstrates a simple SOAP-based web service implementation using Java. The primary goal is to provide a clear, working example of how to create, expose, and consume SOAP services—ideal for beginners and those looking to integrate SOAP solutions into their applications.

## Overview

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. This repository provides a working example of how to:

- Define a SOAP service interface.
- Implement business logic.
- Publish the service using a Java server.
- Consume the service with a client.

This example is intended to be minimal, easy to understand, and extensible for more advanced use cases.

## Features

- **Service Definition:** Clearly defined WSDL (Web Service Description Language) for interoperability.
- **Business Logic Layer:** Contains a simple implementation for demonstration.
- **Server & Client:** Includes both the service provider and a sample consumer.
- **Error Handling:** Demonstrates basic SOAP fault handling.
- **Extensible:** Easily add new operations or entities.

**Key Files:**
- `ServiceEndpoint.java`: SOAP service interface.
- `ServiceImpl.java`: Implementation of the service.
- `service.wsdl`: WSDL file for the service.
- `ServiceTest.java`: Unit tests for the service.
- `pom.xml`: Maven build configuration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 8+**
- **Maven 3+**

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naman-sriv/SOAP-Service-Example.git
cd SOAP-Service-Example
```

### Build the Project

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Building & Running

### Run the SOAP Service

The service is published using a simple Java main method (typically in `ServiceImpl.java`).

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.soap.ServiceImpl"
```

The service should be available at:  
`http://localhost:8080/soap/service`

### Access the WSDL

Visit:  
`http://localhost:8080/soap/service?wsdl`

## Consuming the Service

You can consume the service using any SOAP client library (Java, .NET, Python, etc.) or tools like **SoapUI**.

#### Example Java Client

Refer to the `Client.java` file in `src/main/java/com/example/soap/` for a sample client implementation.

#### Using SoapUI

1. Import the WSDL URL.
2. Generate requests and interact with the service.

## Testing

Unit tests are provided in `src/test/java/com/example/soap/ServiceTest.java`.

To run tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

## Technologies Used

- **Java JAX-WS:** For SOAP web service implementation.
- **Maven:** Build automation and dependency management.
- **JUnit:** Unit testing.
- **SoapUI:** Service testing and debugging.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q:** I see a port conflict error.  
**A:** Ensure port `8080` is free or change the port in your configuration.

**Q:** Cannot access the WSDL?  
**A:** Make sure the service is running and check for firewall or network issues.

**Q:** How do I add new operations?  
**A:** Define them in the service interface and implement them in the service class. Update the WSDL if needed.
